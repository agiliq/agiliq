<p>You already know what your <em>right</em> hourly price is. However many clients are going to request a fixed price. Some may request this even before they have a specification. <img src='http://agiliq.com/softwareconsulting/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>You can give a fixed price if</p>
<ul>
<li>The specifications are well defined.</li>
<li>You know how to handle change requests.</li>
<li>You are good with estimating time</li>
<li>You are comfortable with the client. (It requires experience and git feeling to decide which client will demand a lot of changes and insist they are part of the original specifications.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>ALL</em> of these do not exist, you should be very wary of committing to a fixed price quote and instead insist on a hourly/weekly pricing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://agiliq.com/softwareconsulting/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/How-to-decide-on-your-pricing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-301" title="How to decide on your pricing" src="http://agiliq.com/softwareconsulting/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/How-to-decide-on-your-pricing.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>A year has 52 weeks, a week has 40 billable hours. So say a developer&#8217;s yearly salary is X$. Can you do X$/(52 * 40) to come to an hourly rate. <em>Hell no</em>.</p>
<p>You need to factor in</p>
<ul>
<li>Downtime when you are looking for clients</li>
<li>Cost of infrastructure like servers, desktop and office space</li>
<li>Vacations</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to take an yearly salary and divide that by 1000.</p>
<p>Of course many clients are going to ask for a fixed pricing. If you are comfortable with the client and specifications are well defined, you should provide a fixed quote.</p>
<p>Breakdown the specs in smaller unit of work. (Not larger than a day and then estimate the amount of work in hours. Multiply that by your hourly rate and add 20% margin as a contingency.) This should give you a guideline to do a fixed rate quote.</p>
