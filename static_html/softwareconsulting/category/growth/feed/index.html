<p>Technology and especially software change very fast. As a software consultant you are expected to be on the cutting edge of everything. Ongoing learning and skill improvement is a critical area which you need to include both the budget and time for in your projections.</p>
<p>* Go to (and when possible speak at) industry events<br />
* Read new books (and review them on your blog)<br />
* If you are a visual learner (like me) take subscription to Video tutorial sites</p>
<p>For example I have a subscription to Peepcode, Thinkvitamin and Lynda.com. I learn well with videos and these sites allow unlimited access to their videos to improve my skills.</p>
<p>For our team we have a book budget and everyone can request books (or e-books) they want. Have a generous learning budget. Money spent on skill up-gradation (for you and your team) is the best money consultants can spend.</p>
