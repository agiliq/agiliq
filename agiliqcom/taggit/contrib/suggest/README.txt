taggit.contrib.suggest
======================

This add on module allows you to easily associate keywords and regular
expressions with a Tag object. This is useful to help keep your database
getting filled up with several similar tags that really represent the same
thing.

For example, if your site is a humor site you might want to collapse all of
#fun, #funny, #funnies, #hilarious, #rofl, and #lol into one tag #funny.  The
``suggest_tags()`` function in ``taggit.contrib.suggest.utils`` will give you a
list of tags that seem appropriate for the text content given to it.

Unlike the rest of ``django-taggit``, ``suggest`` requires Django 1.2.

Usage
=====

Put ``'taggit.contrib.suggest'`` into ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and run a syncdb to
create the necessary models.  This will add ``Keywords`` and
``Regular Expression`` inlines to the default ``django-taggit`` admin.  Once
you've populated those based on your site you can do a simple:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from taggit.contrib.suggest.utils import suggest_tags

    tags = suggest_tags(content='Some textual content...')


TODO
====

* In a later version I hope to a simple way to help determine keywords for you
  automatically, by learning from your past tags and content.
