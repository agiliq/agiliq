		<description><![CDATA[You know your method is deeply flawed, right? Reading levels are really lousy, especially on technical text. What it can show at best is the level of the intended audience of the articles. So I could conclude that articles written about PHP are meant for a wider audience than those written about Haskell. Or I could conclude that people writing about PHP know better how to express their subject in short sentences than people writing about Haskell. Or perhaps PHP appears in texts on topics entirely different from Haskell. And a more technical issue: even the name of the language can cause a shift in readability, since e.g. Lisp is just one syllable, whereas Haskell takes two.

Ok, sorry to kill your joke...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What the fuck is this, are you insane? What have you tried and plotted. Seems like someone who never understood statistics or data mining tried to show off his nerdity. This is seriously pathetic. And at the end of all the hard work, to what conclusion have you reached? 
More importantly what have you tried to put over here? This data to anyone who knows even a dime of statistics appears absolute bullshit. 

Ask this question to yourself: have the methodology you tried a standard one? If no, do you have any background in any sort of publication work doing which you feel you might have developed skills which lead you to build such models? If yes: you certainly have gathered no skills doing them. If no: you should consider stopping doing these bullshit. 

I am tired of seeing all such newsletters and blogs from the self proclaimed geeks, entrepreneurs and nerds. Do mankind a favor: stop blogging! You are doing more harm than good. The cloud is getting polluted.]]></description>
