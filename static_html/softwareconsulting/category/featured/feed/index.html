<p>What legal structure you will setup depends on various factors depending on your place of residence and business. I can&#8217;t give you advise (We are a Indian Private Limited Company) without knowing your place of business. Here are the things to keep in mind though. (Ordered by approximate order of importance)</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it minimize your taxes payable</li>
<li>Does it have not-too-onerous accounting and reporting requirements</li>
<li>Does it allow you to deduct business expense easily</li>
<li>Does it allow you to additional equity holders</li>
<li>Does it allow you to close the legal entity without too much hassles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you have the legal entity, I suggest opening a bank account for this. This allows you to keep your personal and business account separate from start, and keep all your tax deductible expenses at a single place.</p>
