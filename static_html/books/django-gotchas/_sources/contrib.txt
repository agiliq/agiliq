Manually Authenticating a User:
---------------------------------

`django.contrib.auth` defines a method named `login`, with the following signature (in the file `__init__.py`)::

	def login(request, user):
		"""
		Persist a user id and a backend in the request. This way a user doesn't
		have to reauthenticate on every request.
	    """

login takes request and the user object. However, passing a standard user object and a request, doesn't log the user in,
when logging in manually, because `authenticate()` sets an extra argument on the user object, that is used for logging in.

Solution:

When loggining in the user manually, first use the authenticate method.::
	
    user_auth = authenticate(username=new_user.username, password=pw1)
    login(request, user_auth)
