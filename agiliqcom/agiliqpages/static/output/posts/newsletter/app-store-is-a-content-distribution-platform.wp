<html><body><div>Wikipedia defines app store as,</div>
 

<div>"The iOS App Store is a digital application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple."</div>

 

<div>Everyday this <strong>application</strong> distribution platform is becoming a <strong>content</strong> distribution platform.</div>

 

<div><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/app-of-the-week/">Apple lists their app of the week here. </a></div>

 

<div>As on 12 Aug 2011, 6 of the 10 last app of the week were content apps. (A content app is one whose primary value is in the content, not the uniqueness of the software)</div>

<div>These apps could have worked almost as well as websites, but the monetization and distribution potential of app store means an app makes more sense.</div>

 

<div>What this means for you.</div>

 

<div>1. App store is a great place to sell content</div>

<div>2. Data which was hard to monetize can be monetized. Case:</div>

<div>It would be a hardsell to get consumers to pay for a website which has zipcode info. Apps like this (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zip-codes/id311107765?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zip-codes/id311107765?mt=8</a>) (and clones) sell everyday in the App store.</div>

<div>3. Similarly nobody will pay for a wallpaper or a recipe from a website, but wallpaper and recipe apps are one of the top performing apps.</div>

<div>4. <strong>There are low hanging fruits to make money in the app store. Get started now.</strong></div>

 

<div>When you have the credit card on file 0.99$ is not so different from $0.</div></body></html>
