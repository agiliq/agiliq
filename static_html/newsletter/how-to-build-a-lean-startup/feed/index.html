		<description><![CDATA[very nice to see people more interested in Lean Startups.

I am following the lean startup model, for Shoppers On, and even though I have not launched my product yet, I can see the change, with the customer centric approach. 

Earlier, I never used to go out to talk to customers, before building a product. With Shoppers On, I started talking to customers with just having a &quot;of the shelf&quot; product in place. After 6 iterations, I am now close to getting out a product which most of the customers are giving positive feedback about, and many more merchants in line to tie-up immediately. 

I suggest Eric Ries book a must read for every entrepreneur.]]></description>
