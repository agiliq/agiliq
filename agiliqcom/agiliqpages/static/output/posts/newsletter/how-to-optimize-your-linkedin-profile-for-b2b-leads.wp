<div><strong>Why should you care about Linkedin?</strong></div>

<div>1. LinkedIn has emerged as the goto place where people look for B2B buying and B2B sales.

2. Traffic from LinkedIn converts almost three times better than FB and Twitter. (Because these vistors are coming with a buy mentality, unlike people on Twitter/FB who come with a browse mentality.)

3. There are 161 million professionals worldwide on Linkedin. Most of them are looking to hire, to get hired or to carry out business activities, unlike FB or Twitter.</div>
