Hacking Django internals.
-------------------------------------
[Here we would some of what goes on behind the scenes.]
Templates. 
How they work.
Swapping out Django template to use another templating engine.
  
ORM.
  How does Django use metaclasses to generate a class from Model class declared by you.

[This would be a high level overview where we would like a topic to be introduced. 
However, we will introduce things as they become used in code. 
For example we introduce templates and in built tags in chapter 3, 
however we would not give description of each template tag at that place. 
As we use a new template tag, we would give a description of that.]
